I'm using ESP32RotaryEncoder, the library by Matthew Clark location on Github (https://github.com/MaffooClock/ESP32RotaryEncoder).
Unfortunately, I found a bug that would occasionally cause the code to crash when pressing the pushbutton.
So, I copied the ESP32RotaryEncoder’s source code into the private library section of this project and fixed the defect in the code.
I’ve informed Matthew of this issue and should he fix it on Github, I’ll go back to using his library.
